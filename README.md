Deliberately making password creation hell

Contributions welcome! Here's what needs to be done:

1. Hook into form submission on the front page to run the password against the API
2. Build up make-hell.js such that it can be dropped in anywhere
3. Add the API docs at the bottom of the page
4. Make it all look pretty and cross-device friendly ðŸ˜Š
